## General Information
- This is an interactive generative art named _Potential_
- This project reminds me of human beings, everyone has potential, its just that it requries some twists and turns in order to achieve it. As you are able to zoom in closer into the artefact, it is the same with humans. "Zoom in" and look deepeer in yourselves and you can find the hidden details that you had all along.
- I did this project because I was a fan of generative art and I wanted to try and make one myself.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Proccessing 4.0.1


## Features
- Zoom in and out by dragging your mouse cursor up and down the artefact.
